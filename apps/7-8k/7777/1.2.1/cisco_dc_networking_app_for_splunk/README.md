# Cisco DC Networking App For Splunk

## Overview

* Nexus Dashboard for the data center stands out as the first comprehensive technology solution in the industry developed by Cisco for network operators to manage day-2 operations in their networks.
* Nexus Dashboard automates troubleshooting and helps with rapid root-cause analysis and early remediation. It also helps infrastructure owners comply with SLA requirements for their users.
* Nexus Dashboard for the data center is supported on Cisco ACI and Cisco NX-OS/DCNM-based deployments.
* Nexus Dashboard collects data on Anomalies, Advisories, Orchestrator (Multi-Site Orchestrator), Flow, Congestion, Protocol and Flow from the Nexus API and parses the fields. Data is mapped with the CIM data models for Enterprise Security use cases.
* ACI is used to gather data from the Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC), index the data, and use it for running searches and building dashboards.
* Nexus 9K provides a scripted input for Splunk that automatically extracts responses of CLI commands from Cisco Nexus 9000 Switches. Moreover, this app gathers Syslog from Cisco Nexus 9000 Switches and provides the same for running searches on data and building dashboards using it.

## SSL Configuration

1. By default, the API calls from the Cisco DC Networking App for Splunk would be verified by SSL. 
Provide the certificate path in ca_certs_path parameter under additional_parameters stanza. Create a stanza if its not present already.
The configurations are present in file: `$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/cisco_dc_networking_app_for_splunk/default/cisco_dc_networking_app_for_splunk_settings.conf`

    ```ini
    [additional_parameters]
    verify_ssl = True
    ca_certs_path = 
    ```
2. In order to bypass the SSL verification, change the SSL verification to False. To do that, navigate to `$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/cisco_dc_networking_app_for_splunk/local/cisco_dc_networking_app_for_splunk_settings.conf` file and change the verify_ssl parameter value to False.
3. To add a custom SSL certificate to the certificate chain, use the option available in the user interface while configuring a Cisco DC deployment.
4. Restart the Splunk in order for the changes to take effect.

## Custom Command
### NX-API Collector (Custom Search Command Reports)

This app provides a generic NX-API collector which empowers users to utilize the NX-API provided by Nexus 9K and periodically track certain data from the 9K switch. It takes switch CLI commands and converts them into NX-API calls, providing data that can be saved as a dashboard.

Every time the saved dashboard is clicked, Splunk makes a call to the switch using NX-API and fetches current data for that dashboard. Note that this data will not be saved in the Splunk database.

    Note: The custom command can only be executed with admin access.

Please follow the steps below to generate custom command reports:

1. Go to the search option and enter your search in the search bar.
   You have different options for the custom search command:

   * `| ciscodcnxapicollect account="your configured Nexus 9K account" command="your CLI"` (Make sure the account for the device is already configured through the configuration page)

2. Click on Save As and click on Dashboard Panel to store your result in the dashboard.
3. Enter the Dashboard Title. You have to include the keyword "report" in the dashboard title.
4. You can see your dashboard in Custom Reports (in the menu bar).

## Alerts

* Splunk Nexus Dashboard Advisory Alert
    * This alert will be triggered if at any point the severity is critical for advisories data in Nexus Dashboard Server.
    * By default, the alert will be disabled.

* Splunk Nexus Dashboard Anomaly Alert
    * This alert will be triggered if at any point the severity is critical for anomalies data in Nexus Dashboard Server.
    * By default, the alert will be disabled.

## Alerts Configuration

* Enable Alert
    * Go to `Alerts` under `Searches, reports, and alerts` on the navigation bar.
    * Click on Edit for `Splunk Nexus Dashboard Advisory Alert` or `Splunk Nexus Dashboard Anomaly Alert`.
    * In the dropdown, click on `Enable`.

* To set the email ID on which the mail is intended, follow these steps:
    * Go to `Alerts` under `Searches, reports, and alerts` on the navigation bar.
    * Click on Edit for `Splunk Nexus Dashboard Advisory Alert` or `Splunk Nexus Dashboard Anomaly Alert`.
    * In the dropdown, click on `Edit Alert`.
    * Under the `Trigger Action` section, write your Email ID in the `To` field.
    * Click on Save.

## Data Model
### ND
* This data model contains six datasets:
    * Advisories - Maps advisories details from the Nexus Dashboard Environment.
    * Anomalies - Maps anomalies details from the Nexus Dashboard Environment.
    * Flows - Maps flows details from the Nexus Dashboard Environment.
    * Endpoints - Maps endpoints details from the Nexus Dashboard Environment.
    * Congestion - Maps congestions details from the Nexus Dashboard Environment.
    * Protocols - Maps protocols details from the Nexus Dashboard.
* The acceleration for the data model is disabled by default.
* As all the dashboards are populated using data model queries and real-time search doesn't work with the data model, all the real-time search filters are disabled.
* If you want to improve the performance of dashboards, you must enable the acceleration of the data model. Please follow the steps below:
    * On the Splunk menu bar, click on Settings -> Data Models.
    * Filter with Cisco DC Networking App for Splunk.
    * In the "Actions" column, click on Edit and then click Edit Acceleration. This will display the pop-up menu for Edit Acceleration.
    * Check or uncheck the Accelerate checkbox to "Enable" or "Disable" data model acceleration respectively.
    * If acceleration is enabled, select the summary range to specify the acceleration period. The recommended acceleration period is 7 days. The acceleration period can be changed as per user convenience.
    * To save acceleration changes, click on the Save button.
* Warning: Accelerated data models help in improving the performance of the dashboard but they increase disk usage on the indexer.

### ACI
* This app stores the indexed data in accelerated data models and builds dashboards by fetching data from these models. Below is the list of data models created in the app for ACI:
    * Auth - Maps authentication details from the ACI Environment.
    * Health - Maps health and fault information for all the MOs of given classes.
    * Fault - Maps to defects or faults present on APIC.
    * Systems - Maps to general information for all the MOs of given classes.
    * Counters - Maps to general information for all the MOs of given classes.
    * Statistics - Maps to statistical data for all the MOs of given classes.

# Troubleshooting
## ND

* If you attempt to delete an input and encounter an error such as: `Object id=cisco_nexus_dashboard://"Input name" cannot be deleted in config=inputs.`, this indicates that the input is a default input and cannot be deleted by the user.

* If you get any error messages in the Configuration tab on the UI, check the messages on the config screen. You can also check logs for validation using the query:
    ```sh
    index=_internal source="*cisco_dc_nd_validation.log*"
    ```

* The main app dashboard can take some time before the data is returned to populate some of the panels. To verify that you are receiving all of the expected data, run this search after several minutes:
    ```sh
    index="your_index" | stats count by sourcetype
    ```

* In particular, you should see these sourcetypes:
    * cisco:dc:nd:anomalies
    * cisco:dc:nd:advisories
