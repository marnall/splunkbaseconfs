#### Lifecycle Management via KVStore

- Life-cycle tracking mechanism is functioning in the add-on to determine the presence or absence of infrastructure assets based on real-time API responses from Cisco Intersight.
- A scheduled saved search runs every 24 hours, iterating across 49 supported object types. For each object type, it performs targeted API calls to retrieve the latest data.
- Assets that are no longer returned by the Intersight API (e.g., due to decommissioning, disconnection, or removal) are automatically marked as Absent in the corresponding KV Store collection.
- This approach ensures the KV Store reflects the current live state of the infrastructure, separate from historical data in the index.
- Enables more accurate capacity planning, compliance tracking, and audit reporting by highlighting inventory changes over time.

#### Historical Data Migration from Index to KVStore
- An inherent saved search is added in the add-on to assist in migrating previously indexed inventory data into the appropriate KV Store collections.
- Migration is triggered automatically upon upgrading the add-on from v2.0.1 to any newer add-on supported version, ensuring backward compatibility for existing users.

#### How to Find API Endpoints and Parameters

Before configuring a Custom Input, you need to identify the correct API endpoint and parameters. Cisco Intersight provides multiple ways to discover this information:

##### 1: Finding Inventory/Configuration API Endpoints

**Step 1: Access Intersight API Reference Documentation**

1. **Navigate to API Documentation**:
      - **SaaS (Global)**: `https://intersight.com/apidocs/apirefs/All/`
      - **SaaS (US East)**: `https://us-east-1.intersight.com/apidocs/apirefs/All/`
      - **SaaS (EU Central)**: `https://eu-central-1.intersight.com/apidocs/apirefs/All/`
      - **Appliance**: `https://<your-appliance-hostname>/apidocs/apirefs/All/`

2. **Browse and Search for Endpoints**:
      - The page displays a comprehensive list of all Intersight API endpoints organized alphabetically
      - Use the search box to filter by keyword (e.g., "blade", "storage", "profile", "policy")
      - Each endpoint listing shows:
         - **Endpoint Path**: The API path (e.g., `compute/Blades`, `storage/PureArrays`)
         - **HTTP Methods**: Supported operations (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE)
         - **Description**: Brief explanation of what the endpoint provides

**Step 2: Identify API Endpoint Name**

1. **Select an Endpoint**:
      - Click on an endpoint to view its detailed documentation
      - Example: Click on `compute/Blades` to see blade server API details

2. **Note the Endpoint Path**:
      - The detail page shows the full endpoint URL: `/api/v1/compute/Blades`
      - **For Custom Input Configuration**: Use only the relative path without `/api/v1/`
      - **Correct**: `compute/Blades`, `/api/v1/compute/Blades`
      - **Incorrect**: `Blades` or `blades`
      - **Case Sensitivity**: Endpoint paths are case-sensitive
         - Correct: `compute/Blades`, `storage/PureArrays`, `server/Profiles`
         - Incorrect: `compute/blades`, `Storage/PureArrays`, `Server/profiles`

**Step 3: Identify Available Fields for $select Parameter**

The `$select` parameter allows you to retrieve only specific fields, reducing data volume and improving performance.

1. **Locate the Response Schema**:
      - In the endpoint detail page, scroll to the **Response Schema** or **Model** section
      - This section lists all fields returned by the API with their data types and descriptions

2. **Common Fields Across Most Endpoints**:
      - `Moid` - Managed Object ID (unique identifier for the object)
      - `Name` - Object name or hostname
      - `Model` - Hardware model number
      - `Serial` - Serial number
      - `Status` - Current operational status
      - `Vendor` - Vendor/manufacturer name
      - `Dn` - Distinguished Name (hierarchical identifier)
      - `CreateTime` - Object creation timestamp
      - `ModTime` - Last modification timestamp
      - `ObjectType` - Type of the object (e.g., `compute.Blade`)

3. **Endpoint-Specific Fields**:
      - Review the Response Schema to identify fields specific to your endpoint
      - Example for `compute/Blades`:
            - `NumCpus`, `NumCpuCores`, `TotalMemory` - Hardware specs
            - `OperPowerState`, `OperState` - Operational status
            - `ManagementMode` - Management mode (IMM, IntersightStandalone)
      - Example for `storage/PureArrays`:
            - `Capacity`, `UsedCapacity` - Storage capacity metrics
            - `Version` - Software version
            - `Controllers` - Array controllers information

4. **Construct the $select Parameter**:
      - List field names separated by commas (no spaces). **NOTE**: Field names are case-sensitive.
      - **Correct**: `Moid,Name,Model,Serial,Status`
      - **Incorrect**: `Moid, Name, Model` (spaces not allowed), `moid, name, model` (field names are case-sensitive).
      - **Best Practice**: Always include `Moid` and `ObjectType` for proper identification

**Step 4: Identify Expandable Relationships for $expand Parameter**

The `$expand` parameter allows you to include related objects in the response, avoiding additional API calls. For more details on `$expand` parameter, refer - [Intersight API Documentation](https://us-east-1.intersight.com/apidocs/introduction/query/#filter-query-option-filtering-the-resources)
   
   **Caution with $expand**:
      - Each expanded relationship significantly increases response size
      - Expanding too many relationships can cause:
         - **Broken Pipe errors** during data transmission
         - Utilises higher network bandwidth
         - Higher memory consumption
         - Indexing performance degradation
      - **Best Practice**:
         - Only expand relationships you actually need for your use case.
         - Use $select in expanded relationships to fetch only required fields.

**Step 5: Construct Filter Queries for $filter Parameter**

The `$filter` parameter allows you to retrieve only objects matching specific criteria, reducing unnecessary data collection. **NOTE**: Field names are case-sensitive. For more details on `$filter` parameter, refer - [Intersight API Documentation](https://us-east-1.intersight.com/apidocs/introduction/query/#filter-query-option-filtering-the-resources)

**Step 6: Test the API Endpoint (Recommended)**

Before configuring the Custom Input, test your API endpoint with the parameters:

1. **Using Intersight API Documentation "Try it out" Feature**:
      - Some endpoint pages have an interactive "Try it out" button
      - Enter your query parameters ($filter, $select, $expand)
      - Click "Execute" to see the actual API response
      - Verify the response contains expected data

2. **Verify Before Configuration**:
      - Endpoint returns data (not empty)
      - Selected fields appear in response
      - Expanded relationships contain expected nested data
      - Filter reduces results as expected
      - Response size is reasonable (not too large)

##### 2: Finding Telemetry Metrics Information

**Step 1: Identify Metrics Name from Intersight Metrics Explorer**

The most reliable way to find the exact metrics name and understand the query structure is by using the Intersight Metrics Explorer UI and examining its Data Query payload.

1. **Access Metrics Explorer**:
      - Log in to your Cisco Intersight instance
      - Navigate to: `Analyze > Explorer`
      - This is the interactive metrics visualization tool in Intersight

2. **Select a Metric to Visualize**:
      - Click on the **Metric** dropdown at the top
      - Browse through available metrics organized by category. Some examples are:
         - **Fan Metrics**: Fan Speed
         - **Memory Metrics**: ECC Errors (Correctable, Uncorrectable)
         - **Network Metrics**: Bandwidth Utilization, I/O, Errors
         - **Temperature Metrics**: Temperature readings
         - **Power Metrics**: Power consumption, Energy
         - **CPU Metrics**: CPU Utilization
         - **Storage Metrics**: Storage utilization, I/O operations
      - Select a metric you want to collect (e.g., "Fan Speed")

3. **Configure Visualization (Optional)**:
      - Select time range, sub type (Sum, Minimum, Maximum, Average, Latest), and Inventory Dimensions
      - This helps visualize the data before configuring Custom Input

4. **Access the Query Code Section**:
      - Once the metric graph is generated, beneath it, look for the **Query Code** section.
      - This section shows the actual JSON payload sent to the Intersight API to fetch the relevant metrics.
      - This payload contains all the information you need for Custom Input configuration.

5. **Examine the Payload Structure**:
   
   The Data Query payload will look similar to this example:
   
   ```json
   {
      "queryType": "groupBy",
      "dataSource": "PhysicalEntities",
      "granularity": {
         "type": "period",
         "period": "PT12H",
         "timeZone": "Asia/Calcutta",
         "origin": "2025-08-17T10:09:00.000Z"
      },
      "intervals": [
         "2025-08-17T10:09:00.000Z/2025-11-17T10:09:00.000Z"
      ],
      "dimensions": [
         "host.name",
         "id",
         "intersight.domain.id"
      ],
      "filter": {
         "type": "and",
         "fields": [
         {
            "type": "selector",
            "dimension": "id",
            "value": "636d5c566176752d35d2999e"
         },
         {
            "type": "selector",
            "dimension": "instrument.name",
            "value": "hw.fan"
         }
         ]
      },
      "aggregations": [
         {
         "type": "longSum",
         "name": "count",
         "fieldName": "hw.fan.speed_count"
         },
         {
         "type": "longSum",
         "name": "hw.fan.speed-Sum",
         "fieldName": "hw.fan.speed"
         },
         {
         "type": "thetaSketch",
         "name": "endpoint_count",
         "fieldName": "id"
         }
      ],
      "postAggregations": [
         {
         "type": "expression",
         "name": "hw-fan-speed-Avg",
         "expression": "(\"hw.fan.speed-Sum\" / \"count\")"
         }
      ]
   }
   ```

6. **Reference: Common Metrics Names**:
   
   You can find metrics names in the official documentation: [Intersight API Documentation](https://intersight.com/apidocs/introduction/supported-metrics-overview/)
   
   Some example metric names are:

   **Fan Metrics**:
      - `hw.fan.speed` - Fan speed in RPM
   
   **Memory Metrics**:
      - `hw.errors_correctable_ecc_errors` - Correctable ECC errors
      - `hw.errors_uncorrectable_ecc_errors` - Uncorrectable ECC errors
   
   **Network Metrics**:
      - `hw.network.bandwidth.utilization_receive` - Network RX bandwidth utilization
      - `hw.network.bandwidth.utilization_transmit` - Network TX bandwidth utilization
      - `hw.network.io_receive` - Network receive I/O bytes
      - `hw.network.io_transmit` - Network transmit I/O bytes
      - `hw.errors_network_receive_crc` - CRC errors
      - `hw.errors_network_receive_all` - Total receive errors
      - `hw.errors_network_transmit_all` - Total transmit errors

   **NOTE**: For Custom Input Configuration use the metric name format (with dots)
      - **Correct**: `hw.fan.speed`, `hw.errors_correctable_ecc_errors`, `hw.temperature`
      - **Incorrect**: `FanSpeed`, `CpuUtilization`, `Temperature`

**Step 2: Identify Inventory Dimensions (Group By Fields) from Explorer Payload**

Dimensions are the fields you can use to correlate metrics data with Intersight Inventory. The Metrics Explorer payload shows exactly which dimensions are available.

1. **Locate Dimensions in the Payload**:
      - In the Data Query payload, find the `dimensions` array
      - Example from the payload above:
         ```json
            "dimensions": [
               "host.name",
               "id",
               "intersight.domain.id"
            ]
         ```
         - These are the exact dimension names you have to use in the **Group By** field
         - It is recommended to select as many dimension fields as necessary to support the creation of a comprehensive custom dashboard for the collected metrics.

2. **Construct the Group By Field**:
      - Copy dimension names from the payload's `dimensions` array
      - For Custom Input **Group By** field, enter comma-separated dimension names. **NOTE**: Field names are case-sensitive.
      - **Correct**: `host.name,id,intersight.domain.id`
      - **Incorrect**: `host.name, "id"` (no spaces, no qoutes)

3. **Best Practices for Group By**:
      - **Always include** `intersight.domain.id` for multi-domain environments
      - **Include** `host.name` for host-level aggregation and identification
      - **Include component-specific IDs** (`id`, `interface`, `disk_id`) for granular inventory metadata
      - **Avoid too many dimensions** as it increases data volume and cardinality
      - **Match the Explorer payload** - use the same dimensions shown in the working query

**Step 3: Verify Metric Name and Metric field names with Explorer payload**

The add-on automatically generates field names for metrics aggregations based on the metrics name provided. However, you can verify and customize these if needed.

1. **'Edit Metrics Field' checkbox**

   While configuring the inputs, the field names for different metric types (Sum, Minimum, Maximum, Average, Latest) are auto generated. It is recommended to verify these field names with Intersight Explorer query code. (**NOTE**: Field names are case-sensitive).
      - Click on 'Edit Metrics Field' checkbox
      - Field names corresponsing to each metric type will be shown in the Input configuring pop-up.

3. **Verify Field Names with Explorer Payload**:

   In the Data Query payload, find the `aggregations` array:
     ```json
      "aggregations": [
         {
            "type": "longSum",
            "name": "hw_fan_speed_sum",
            "fieldName": "hw_fan_speed"
         },
         {
            "type": "longMin",
            "name": "hw_fan_speed_min",
            "fieldName": "hw_fan_speed_min"
         }
      ]
     ```
   
   - It is recommended to verify the auto-generated field names per metric type in Splunk Input pop-up with `fieldName` key from the payload.
   - **If they match**: No action needed, use auto-generated values
   - **If they differ**: You'll need to manually update the field names in Splunk Input pop-up.

## TROUBLESHOOTING
### General Checks
* If your dashboard is not populating, then below checks should be done:
   - Ensure the index in the macro `cisco_intersight_index` matches the data present in the index. (To open macro go to Settings → Advanced search → Search Macros → cisco_intersight_index).
   - Ensure KV store configuration is done for the same instance you are checking dashboard on.
   - If the data model `Cisco Intersight` is accelerated, ensure that the macro `cisco_intersight_summariesonly` is set to summariesonly=true.
   - If the data model `Cisco Intersight` is accelerated, then check the percentage of acceleration in the data model. If the percentage is not 100%, all data may not load.  (To open data model go to Settings → Data Models → Cisco Intersight)
* 'Inventory Browser' dashboard is not structured after upgrade to v3.1.0
   - As part of upgrade to v3.1.0, certain migration savedsearches are ran to collect the required data in Splunk to support the latest features of the add-on included in v3.1.0. Hence, till the savedsearches are not disabled, newer inventory updates will not be fetched.
   - In order to verify if the savedsearches are ran successfully, search for below logs using SPL. Once the below logs are found, disable the inputs and then re-enable the inputs to begin the data collection workflow.
      - `index=_internal source="*ta_intersight*" "Successfully disabled saved search: splunk_ta_cisco_intersight_unified_edge_migration"`
      - `index=_internal source="*ta_intersight*" "Successfully disabled saved search: splunk_ta_cisco_intersight_index_to_kvstore_migration_inventory"`
      - `index=_internal source="*ta_intersight*" "Successfully disabled saved search: splunk_ta_cisco_intersight_metrics_checkpoint_reset"`
      - `index=_internal source="*ta_intersight*"  "Successfully disabled saved search: splunk_ta_cisco_intersight_inventory_checkpoint_reset"`
* To troubleshoot Cisco Intersight Add-On for Splunk, check `$SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/ta_intersight_*.log` or user can search `index="_internal" source=*ta_intersight_*.log*` query to see all the logs in UI. Also, user can use `index="_internal" source=*ta_intersight_*.log* ERROR` query to see ERROR logs in the Splunk UI.
* Note that all log files of this App will be generated in `$SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/` directory.

### KV Store Troubleshooting (Distributed Environment Only)

If dashboards are missing or showing partial data in a distributed setup (Search Head and Indexers are separate), follow the below steps:

1. Go to:  
   `Settings → Lookup Tables → KV Lookup REST Configuration`

2. Ensure the following settings:
      - **Search Head IP address** is added correctly.
      - **Splunk REST Host URL** should be `localhost` or the remote indexer without `http/https`.
      - **Port** should be the Splunk management port (default: `8089`).
      - **Username/Password** are needed only when authenticating against remote REST endpoints.

3. Make sure the Search Head can reach the Indexer’s management port over the network (default is `8089`).

4. Additionally, verify `limits.conf` (if customized) on all involved nodes:
   ```
      [kvstore]
       max_documents_per_batch_save = <your_value>
       max_size_per_batch_save_mb = <your_value>
   ```

**Note**: These KV Store configuration steps are required only for distributed Splunk environments.
For standalone or test setups, these can be skipped.

### Custom Input Troubleshooting

#### Custom Input Not Collecting Data

1. **Verify Input Configuration**:
      - Check that the input is enabled in the Inputs tab
      - Verify the API endpoint is correctly specified (case-sensitive)
      - Ensure the account credentials have necessary permissions

2. **Check Logs**:
   ```
   index="_internal" source="*ta_intersight_custom_input.log*"
   ```
   Look for messages with:
      - `message=custom_input_error` - General errors
      - `message=custom_input_api_detection` - API type detection
      - `message=custom_input_filter_applied` - Filter application

3. **Common Issues**:

   **403 Forbidden Error**:
      - **Cause**: Insufficient permissions, invalid API, or incorrect case sensitivity
      - **Solution**: 
         - Verify OAuth2.0 application permissions in Intersight
         - Check API endpoint exists: `https://<your-intersight>/apidocs/`
         - Ensure correct case (e.g., `/compute/Blades` not `/compute/blades`)
      - **Log Message**: Look for `403` or `permission` in logs

   **404 Not Found Error**:
      - **Cause**: Incorrect API endpoint spelling or case mismatch
      - **Solution**: Verify endpoint in Intersight API documentation
      - **Example**: `/storage/PureArrays` (correct) vs `/storage/purearrays` (incorrect)

   **Broken Pipe Error**:
      - **Cause**: Data payload too large due to excessive `$expand` usage
      - **Solution**: 
      - Reduce number of expanded objects
      - Add `$filter` to limit results
      - Increase collection interval
      - **Log Message**: Look for `Broken Pipe` or `Connection reset`

   **No Data Collected**:
      - **Cause**: API returns empty results
      - **Solution**: 
         - Verify objects exist in Intersight for the endpoint
         - Check if filters are too restrictive
         - Test endpoint in Intersight API docs first

   **KVStore Collection Not Created**:
      - **Cause**: KVStore access issues or input misconfiguration
      - **Solution**: 
         - Verify KVStore is enabled
         - Check KVStore configuration in Settings
         - Review `ta_intersight_custom_input.log` for KVStore errors

4. **Telemetry-Specific Issues**:
      - **No Domains Found**: Ensure inventory input has collected domain data first
      - **Invalid Metrics Name**: Verify metric name exists in Intersight (e.g., `hw.fan.speed`)
      - **Missing Aggregations**: Ensure at least one metrics type (sum/min/max/avg) is selected

5. **Validation Steps**:
   - Test API endpoint in Intersight API documentation before creating input
   - Start with simple configuration (no filters/expansions)
   - Monitor first collection cycle in logs
   - Verify data is being indexed with the configured sourcetype
   - For Inventory APIs: Check KVStore collection created with lifecycle tracking enabled

#### Maximum Custom Inputs Limit

The add-on supports a maximum of **10 custom inputs**. If you reach this limit:
- **Error Message**: "Reached the maximum of 10 custom inputs in the add-on"
- **Solution**: Delete unused custom inputs or consolidate data collection
- **Note**: This limit ensures optimal performance and resource utilization

### Data Collection
* If data collection is not working then ensure that the internet is active (On a proxy machine, if proxy is enabled) and also ensure that the kvstore is enabled.
* Check `ta_intersight*.log*` file for Cisco Intersight Add-On for Splunk for Splunk data collection for any relevant error messages.
* For Custom Inputs specifically, check `ta_intersight_custom_input.log` for detailed error messages and API call information.

## Limitations  

* The upcoming version of Cisco Intersight Add-On for Splunk fetches data from Cisco Intersight using Cisco Intersight RESTFul APIs. This approach may introduce minor latency as APIs will be executed at a specific interval. To overcome this limitation, data collection logic of the add-on can be planned to shift to stream based data collection. This mechanism ensures continuous streaming of data and ensures metrics are available in real time.
