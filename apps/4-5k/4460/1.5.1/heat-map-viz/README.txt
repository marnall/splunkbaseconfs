Who is this app for?
This app is for anyone who wants to display several metrics on a small area of a dashboard.

How does the app work?
This app provides a visualization that you can use in your own apps and dashboards.

To use it in your dashboards, simply install the app, and create a search that provides the values you want to display.

Usecases for the Heat Map Visualization:
Displaying server metrics like CPU, Memory, I/O, and Disk usage over time
Comparing sales volume by category over time
Showing related application metrics in a discreet dashboard panel
Highlighting any metrics relative to other entities
The following fields can be used in the search:
_time (required): The easiest way to construct a search is to use the | timechart command, with a by clause.
category fields (required): Each field name will become a label on the side, with the values being used to set the color based on thresholds. The order of the fields determines the order shown in the viz.

Example Search
| gentimes start=-7 increment=4h
| eval "Server Availability"=random()%100, "Customer Satisfaction"=random()%100,"Server Performance"=random()%100, _time=starttime
| table _time, "Server Availability","Customer Satisfaction","Server Performance"

Tokens
Tokens are generated each time you click a cell. This can be useful if you want to populate another panel on the dashboard with a custom search, or link to a new dashboard with the tokens carrying across.

Value: This is the numeric field for the cell you clicked. Default value: $hm_token_value$
Label: This is the field name for the cell you clicked. Default value: $hm_token_label$
Time: This is the '_time' field for the selection. Default value: $hm_token_time$
Limits
The visualization is bound by the following limits:

Total results: 50,000
