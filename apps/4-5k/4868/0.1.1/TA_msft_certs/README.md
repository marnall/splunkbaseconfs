 Microsoft Certificates Add-On for Splunk®

## Introduction
The Microsoft Certificates add-on for Splunk® provides functionality to ingest certificate information from the certificate store on Windows servers and workstations. The add-on also allows the collection of certificate information for issued certificates from Microsoft Certificate Servers.  

## Prerequisites
PowerShell execution policy must allow the execution of scripts on servers where data will be collected.


## Installation
Install the add-on on all search heads, install on all Windows forwarders where certificate data is to be collected. 


## Configuration
The add-on is provided with two default inputs, which are disabled by default. It is recommended this inputs in this file be used as a template to configure inputs on forwarders as needed. See example inputs below:


`` [powershell://CertStore-CA-Issued] ``<br>
`` disabled = 1 ``<br>
`` script = . "$SplunkHome\etc\apps\TA_microsoft_certificates\bin\Get-CAIssuedCertificates.ps1" ``<br>
`` schedule = 0 15 * * 0-6 ``<br>
`` sourcetype = windows:certstore:ca:issued ``<br>
`` index = win_certstore_data ``<br>

The example input above will collect issued certificates information from the local CA.



``[powershell://CertStore-Local] ``<br>
``disabled = 1 ``<br>
``script = . "$SplunkHome\etc\apps\TA_microsoft_certificates\bin\Get-LocalStoreCertificates.ps1" ``<br>
``schedule = 0 15 * * 0-6 ``<br>
``sourcetype = windows:certstore:local ``<br>
``index = win_certstore_data ``<br>

The example input above will collect certificate information from the local certificate store. The default is to recurse through all containers.
