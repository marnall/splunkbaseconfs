exclude_apps = Comma- or newline-separated list of Splunk app folder names to exclude from observation (literal match against the folder under $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/).

exclude_path_glob = Comma- or newline-separated POSIX glob patterns evaluated against paths RELATIVE to $SPLUNK_HOME/etc (e.g. apps/*/local/passwd*). Equivalent conf path: [observation_scope] exclude_path_glob.
